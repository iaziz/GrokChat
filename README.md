[![bsLP1.gif](https://s14.gifyu.com/images/bsLP1.gif)](https://gifyu.com/image/bsLP1)Installation Instructions

Create Directory Structure:

mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/grok_chat/start/grok_chat/{plugin,python}

Save the grok_chat.vim file in ~/.vim/pack/grok_chat/start/grok_chat/plugin/ and grok_chat.py in ~/.vim/pack/grok_chat/start/grok_chat/python/.
Install Python Dependencies: Install the openai Python package:

in plugin directory "grok-chat.vim" file line 60:

replace user to your user

python_dir = '/Users/YOURUSERNAME/.vim/pack/grok_chat/start/grok_chat/python'


pip install openai

Set API Key: Set your xAI API key as an environment variable:

export XAI_API_KEY='your-xai-api-key'

You can obtain an API key from https://x.ai/api.[](https://lablab.ai/t/xai-beginner-tutorial)
Reload Vim: Start Vim and run :packloadall to load the plugin, or restart Vim.

Usage
Run :GrokChat to open a new chat buffer.
Type your message in the buffer.
Press Ctrl-g to send the message to the Grok API.
The response will appear below your prompt, prefixed with ðŸ¦œ:.
Continue the conversation by typing new prompts and pressing Ctrl-g.

Notes
Dependencies: Ensure curl and Python 3 are installed, as Vimâ€™s Python interface requires them.
API Key Security: Store the API key securely in an environment variable, not in the source code.
Error Handling: The Python script includes basic error handling, displaying errors in the buffer if the API call fails.
Extensibility: You can extend the plugin by adding commands like :GrokChatNew for new sessions or :GrokChatHistory for managing chat history, similar to existing plugins.
Compatibility: The plugin is designed for Vim but should work in Neovim. For Neovim-specific features, consider using Lua, as seen in plugins like gp.nvim.
